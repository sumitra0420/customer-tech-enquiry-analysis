# Customer Tech Enquiry Analysis

This project supports customer technical enquiries related to company products. When customers contact customer service via email or phone and describe an issue, the support team can use this system to analyse the problem. Based on historical support records and resolved cases, the system suggests relevant solutions to help resolve customer issues efficiently.
